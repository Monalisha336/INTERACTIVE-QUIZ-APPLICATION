In a quiz application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, scripts can potentially interrupt or disrupt the application's normal flow if not properly secured. For example, malicious scripts injected through user inputs or browser extensions can manipulate the DOM, alter quiz questions, change answers, or even submit forms automatically. JavaScript running in the background could be exploited to skip questions, force specific feedback, or tamper with scores. Additionally, if the application does not validate user interactions correctly, users might use browser developer tools to modify variables, bypass question logic, or prematurely end the quiz. To prevent such interruptions, it is essential to sanitize inputs, limit DOM access, and handle events securely to maintain the integrity of the quiz flow.
